However, one day a mysterious cloud covered the skies in pitch darkness. With it came along violent creatures that threatened the peopleâ€™s safety. These monsters reside in different locations across the forest and will often emerge, interfering with resource gatherers. Many young villagers have risen to fight these monsters, but they were no match for their strength. The forest is being destroyed, and the peace of our village is threatened.
